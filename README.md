# ereddy_median_filter

For this program we were given the method headers we were to use along with a short comment describing what each method was supposed to do. All other code is entirely my own.

What does this program do?
Imagine that you are taking a picture of yourself in front of the Eiffel Tower. You have 20 pictures that are exactly the same, but every single one was photobombed by different absentminded tourists. How do you remove this unwanted noise? The median filter program will take in any number of images and filter out any pixel that does not match the rest in order to produce a clean, uncorrupted image. The program uses files as the input and outputs a jpg image. Input files must all be of the same dimension.
