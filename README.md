# ereddy_median_filter
This program was created using Java in an intermediate computer science class I took during the fall of 2021. In this program I use exception handling, inputting and outputting files, and ArrayLists to remove unwanted noise from a number of images and produce one uncorrupted image.

For this program we were given the method headers we were to use along with a short comment describing what each method was supposed to do. All other code is entirely my own.
